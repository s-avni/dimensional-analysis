## About The Project

The only automatic dinmensional analysis tool that I found online is that of Wolfram Alpha, but it does not work well. Python's Pint library has a great dimensional anlaysis tool, but requires an end-user to know how to code. This motivated me to create a quick website to wrap the Pint code and make a friendly user interface for non-techy people.

## Todos

1. sitemap.xml
2. input validation
3. dynamic number of inputs (more than MAX)
4. shortcut inputs: e.g. T for [time]
5. talk about using actuall units, e.g. "meter"
